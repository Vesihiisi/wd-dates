# WD-Dates

This is a Pywikibot-powered script to import people's birth and death dates from Wikipedia articles to Wikidata. It currently has support for the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian (bokmål) and Polish Wikipedias. Used by [VesihiisiBot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:VesihiisiBot).


## Usage

The script takes as input a list of Wikipedia articles, one title per line, such as a pagepile generated by Petscan. Pass the Wikipedia langauge version as an argument:

```
